## 📌 Project Overview

Days **30–32** of my 60-Day Data Analytics Roadmap focused on taking SQL analysis beyond individual queries and turning it into a complete **business analytics project**.

The goal was to understand how a Data Analyst approaches a real business problem from start to finish:

**Business Problem → Data Investigation → SQL Analysis → Insights → Dashboard → Recommendations**

During this phase, I worked on an **E-Commerce Profitability Analysis** project to investigate why a business was facing profitability issues despite generating revenue.

Instead of looking only at total sales and profit, I used a structured drill-down approach to locate where the business was performing poorly.

### 🔎 Analytical Drilldown

```text
Company
   ↓
Month
   ↓
State
   ↓
City
   ↓
Category
   ↓
Subcategory
   ↓

````

This approach helped me move from a broad business problem to specific areas that management could investigate and act upon.

# 📅 Day 30 — Business Problem & SQL Investigation

## 🎯 Objective

The focus of Day 30 was to approach the dataset from a **business perspective** rather than immediately writing SQL queries.

The business problem was:

> **The company is generating revenue, but profitability is inconsistent. Management needs to understand when and where profit is being lost and which areas require attention.**

### Key Business Questions

* Which months have the highest and lowest revenue?
* Which months are generating losses?
* Which states contribute the most revenue?
* Which states are responsible for the largest losses?
* Is the problem concentrated in specific cities?
* Which categories and subcategories are underperforming?
* Which products are contributing to negative profitability?

### SQL Analysis Performed

* Monthly revenue analysis
* Monthly profit analysis
* Profit Margin %
* State-wise revenue
* State-wise profit
* City-level profitability
* Category-level profitability
* Subcategory-level profitability
* Product-level profitability

### 📌 Key Learning

> **Don't start with random SQL queries. Start with a business question and progressively drill down into the data.**

# 📅 Day 31 — Advanced SQL Business Analysis

## 🎯 Objective

Day 31 focused on using **SQL window functions and advanced analytical techniques** to compare performance over time and identify major contributors.

### 📈 Monthly Performance Analysis

I analyzed monthly revenue and profit from:

**April 2018 → March 2019**

The analysis included:

* Current month sales
* Previous month sales
* Sales growth %
* Current month profit
* Previous month profit
* Profit growth %
* Running profit
* Running revenue

### Window Functions Used

#### LAG()

Used to compare the current month with the previous month.

```sql
LAG(sales) OVER (
    ORDER BY month_date
) AS previous_month_sales
```

This helped calculate Month-over-Month performance.

#### Running Total

```sql
SUM(profit) OVER (
    ORDER BY month_date
) AS running_profit
```

This helped understand how cumulative profitability changed over time.

### 🌍 Revenue Contribution

I also analyzed how much each state contributed to total company revenue.

```sql
ROUND(
    SUM(Amount) * 100.0 /
    SUM(SUM(Amount)) OVER(),
    2
) AS revenue_contribution_pct
```

This helped identify the major revenue-driving states.

### 📊 Profit Margin

Profitability was evaluated using:

```text
Profit Margin % = Profit / Revenue × 100
```

For example:

```text
5% Profit Margin
```

means the company generates approximately **₹5 of profit for every ₹100 of revenue**.

### 🧠 Key Learning

> **Revenue contribution and profitability are two different things.**

A state can contribute a large percentage of revenue while still having poor profitability.

Therefore, both **Revenue** and **Profit Margin** need to be analyzed together.

# 📅 Day 32 — Streamlit Dashboard & Business Communication

## 🎯 Objective

Day 32 focused on converting the SQL analysis into an **interactive business dashboard using Streamlit**.

The purpose was not simply to visualize numbers, but to make the analysis easier for a business user to understand.

### 📊 Dashboard Focus

The dashboard brings together:

* Total Revenue
* Total Profit
* Profit Margin %
* Revenue Contribution %
* Monthly Performance
* Geographic Performance
* City Performance
* Category Performance
* Subcategory Performance
* Product-level Profitability
* Running Revenue
* Running Profit

### 🔎 Interactive Drilldown

```text
Overall Business
       ↓
Monthly Performance
       ↓
State
       ↓
City
       ↓
Category
       ↓
Subcategory
       ↓
Product
```

This allows users to move from a high-level KPI to the specific area responsible for poor performance.

# 💡 Major Business Insights

The analysis showed that profitability problems were not limited to one single area.

### 🌍 Geographic Insight

**Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh together contributed approximately 46% of total revenue.**

However, high revenue contribution did not automatically translate into strong profitability.

### 📉 Profitability Insight

Multiple states contributed to overall losses, with some locations showing significantly worse profit margins than others.

### 🏙️ City-Level Insight

Further drilldown showed that losses were concentrated in specific cities rather than being evenly distributed across all locations.

### 🛍️ Category-Level Insight

Different locations had different profitability drivers.

For example:

```text
Madhya Pradesh
      ↓
Indore
      ↓
Furniture
      ↓
Tables & Chairs
```

While other locations showed different category and subcategory problems.

This demonstrated an important business analytics principle:

> **There is not always one universal root cause. Different segments of a business can have different profitability drivers.**

# 💼 Business Recommendations

### 1. Prioritize High-Loss Areas

Focus management attention on states, cities, categories, and subcategories generating the largest absolute losses.

### 2. Investigate Product-Level Profitability

Identify products consistently generating negative profit and investigate their performance.

### 3. Review Pricing and Costs

Where detailed financial data is available, investigate:

* Selling price
* Procurement cost
* Discount
* Product-level margins

### 4. Monitor High-Revenue but Low-Profit Areas

High sales do not necessarily mean a healthy business.

Revenue contribution should always be evaluated alongside profitability.

### 5. Establish Continuous Monitoring

Track key metrics regularly:

```text
Revenue
Profit
Profit Margin %
Revenue Contribution %
Quantity
Top Loss-Making Products
```

---

# ⚠️ Data Limitation

The available dataset contains fields such as:

* Amount
* Profit
* Quantity
* State
* City
* Category
* Subcategory
* Product

However, explicit fields for **cost, selling price, and discount** are not available.

Therefore, the analysis identifies **where profitability problems occur**, but it cannot conclusively determine whether a particular loss was caused by pricing, procurement cost, or discounting.

Additional financial fields would be required for deeper root-cause analysis.

I learned how window functions such as `LAG()` and running totals can provide deeper business insights.

### Day 32

**SQL Analysis → Interactive Dashboard**

I learned how to communicate analytical findings through an interactive Streamlit dashboard.

The biggest takeaway from Days 30–32:

> **A Data Analyst's job is not just to write SQL or create dashboards. The real value comes from understanding the business problem, finding the right patterns in data, quantifying their impact, and communicating what the business should do next.**
